# ASC-Indicator-Lights-
C++ code in Arduino to control indicator lights as in a car  made for Continuous Assesment in Automotive Software Concepts.
Code was made to switch states when a specific input was detected ,each state would have different outputs eg. turn left led on.
Three buttons and two led were used to test this code.When the left button was pressed once the left led was turned on and when the left button was pressed again  the led turned off , the right side worked on tha same principles however when the middel button(hazzard ) was pressed it would cause  both led to turn on.
Led were programmed to blink every 0.5s.
